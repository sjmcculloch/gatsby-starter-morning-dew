There are over 160 novels based on the Dragonlance world. I've collated various guides and made my own adjustments to present a recommended reading order. The focus is the **Heroes of the Lance** as they are the gateway into the world of Krynn.

## Start Here - War of the Lance

> I've included the **Lost Chronicles** which were written **much later** but fill in story gaps between the original novels.

## Conclusion

I've tried to cover the novels that primarily concern the heroes of the lance, their origins and further adventures. Many other books in the Dragonlance universe cover everything from the cataclysm, Solamnic Knights and legendary heroes of the past (Huma).

You can find a complete list on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dragonlance_novels).
