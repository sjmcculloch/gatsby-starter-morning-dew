Previously I posted a [recommended Dragonlance reading order](/dragonlance-reading-order) based on the heroes of the lance. It focused on the chronicles and the chronological introduction of those characters.

Since a plethora of Dragonlance novels exist (160+), I wanted to have an alternate guide based around individual character paths. If you like a particular character, this guide has the books primarily associated with them.

## Raistlin & Caramon Majere

> Fan favourites of the series, the Majere twins and their turbulent upbringings.
