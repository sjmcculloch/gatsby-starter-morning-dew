The **Legend of Drizzt** is an iconic series of fantasy novels by R.A. Salvatore. The following is a recommended reading order.

## Icewind Dale Trilogy

> I've always preferred reading the events of Icewind Dale before the preludes. These novels were published first and you'd do the same for Star Wars right?

Dwarf Bruenor rescues barbarian Wulfgar from the ruins of Ten-Towns, for 5 years of service - and friendship. With help from renegade dark elf Drizzt, Wulfgar becomes a warrior with brawn and brains. Can the trio stave off the crystal shard forces?

Drizzt Do'Urden still struggles with his own inner voices, voices that call him back to the pitless depths of the Underdark. But louder still are the voices of his newfound friends Bruenor, Wulfgar, and Regis—and the call of a dream that, at long last, Bruenor has decided to fulfill.

<div style={{ padding: '10px'}}>

### The Legacy

Life is good for Drizzt Do'Urden, better than it ever has been for the beleaguered dark elf. His dearest friend, the dwarf Bruenor, has reclaimed his throne, and his adventuring companions, Wulfgar and Catti-brie, are to be wed in the spring. Even the halfling Regis has returned. All the friends are united in the safety and prosperity of Mithril Hall, where streams of silver mithril run deep and dwarven hammers bang out the solemn rhythms of ancient and unending songs.

### Siege of Darkness

While Mithral Hall teems with whispers of the war to come, chaos erupts both above and below ground. On the surface of Faerûn, the first signs of the Time of Troubles make themselves known, forcing deities to assume their mortal forms. Beneath them in the Underdark, all but one drow house has lost their magical powers, and Lolth has handed the reins of leadership over to the demon Errtu.

### Passage to Dawn

It has been six years since the fateful Battle of Mithral Hall; six long years during which Drizzt Do’Urden and Catti-brie have been away from the only place they ever truly felt at home. The pain of a lost companion still weighs heavily on their strong shoulders, but chasing pirates aboard Captain Deudermont's Sea Sprite has been enough to draw their attention away from their grief.

</div>

<div style={{ padding: '10px'}}>

### The Spine of the World

Spending just one day in the torture chambers of the Abyss would be enough to break even the heartiest soul. Wulfgar of Icewind Dale was there for six miserable years. Though Wulfgar has since been freed, he is still haunted by the memories of the pain he endured at his captor Errtu's hands. Hoping to distance himself from his past, he flees to the faraway port city of Luskan—but in so doing, isolates himself from his friends and develops an unhealthy penchant for booze.

When the mark of Wulfgar’s legendary warhammer is found on the person of pirate Sheila Kree, Drizzt Do’Urden knows his friend is in dire need of his help. Thus, Drizzt, Catti-brie, Regis, and Bruenor spring into action, determined to save Wulfgar and recover Aegis-fang once and for all. But the road to victory is paved with monsters—from goblins and ogres to Wulfgar’s own personal demons.

</div>

<div style={{ padding: '10px'}}>

### Servant of the Shard

Powerful assassin Artemis Entreri tightens his grip on the streets of Calimport, driven by the power of his hidden drow supporters. But his sponsor, Jarlaxle, grows ever more ambitious, and Entreri struggles to remain cautious and in control. Soon, the power of the malevolent Crystal Shard grows greater than them both, threatening to draw them into a vast web of treachery from which there will be no escape.

### Road of the Patriarch

ILNEZHARA and TAZMIKELLA are ancient dragons of great power, accustomed to easily manipulating the humans around them. But not all humans are so easily led. When they pushed Entreri and Jarlaxle into the heart of the Bloodstone Lands, not even they could have imagined the strength of the human assassin’s resolve, or the limitless expanse of the drow mercenary’s ambition.

Drizzt Do'Urden has become the Hunter, the bane of the orc hordes still ravaging the North.

But there are a lot of enemies, and even the Hunter is just one lone drow.

### The Two Swords

Dark elf Drizzt Do'Urden would like nothing more than to kill King Obould Many-Arrows, the leader of the slavering orc army that slaughtered his closest friends. Now, it seems even Innovindil, Drizzt’s new moon elf companion, cannot escape the grip of Obould’s murderous scourge. When the orc king steals Innovindil’s beloved pegasus, Drizzt must accompany her on a rescue mission to the northern lands of the frost giants—even if it means suffering the same fate as the Companions.

Drizzt is back, and facing a world changed forever!
An uneasy peace between the dwarves of Mithral Hall and the orcs of the newly established Kingdom of Many-Arrows can't last long. The orc tribes united under Obould begin to fight each other, and Bruenor is determined to finish the war that nearly killed him and almost destroyed everything he's worked to build. But it will take more than swords and axes to bring a lasting peace to the Spine of the World.

But rescuing a city from itself may not be as easy as Deudermont thinks, and when Drizzt can't talk him out of it, he'll be forced to help.

### The Ghost King

With the collapse of Mystra’s Weave and the onslaught of the Spellplague, all of Faerûn is thrown into chaos.

Drizzt draws his swords once more to aid his friends. His lover, Dahlia Sin’felle, can speak of nothing but the moment she will face the Netherese lord Herzgo Alegni once again. Drizzt has already followed a trail of vengeance beside Dahlia. Can he justify one more battle to settle a grudge he does not understand? Artemis Entreri too seeks vengeance. He offers to aid Dahlia in her mission to destroy Alegni. But Charon’s Claw, Alegni’s sentient sword, dominates Entreri’s movements—if not his mind.

In the evolving world of the Forgotten Realms setting, the Sundering has given way to months of cloud-cloaked darkness, and war rages under that oppressive sky.

Centuries ago, in the city of Menzoberranzan, the City of Spiders, the City of Drow, nestled deep in the unmerciful Underdark of Toril, a young weapon master earned a reputation far above his station or that of his poor house.

### Boundless

Split between time and two worlds, Zaknafein had always been conflicted. That inner turmoil was magnified by his inferior position as a male dark elf in the matriarchal drow society. Only his status as one of the greatest warriors—as well as his friendship with the mercenary Jarlaxle—kept him sane. When he finally perished, he was content knowing he left behind a legacy as substantial as his son Drizzt.

Though Zaknafein has endured the most difficult battles, survival has come at a terrible cost, and the fight is far from over.

After the settling dust of the demon uprising and two years of peace, rumblings from the Menzoberranzan drow have Jarlaxle nervous. Worried his allies may be pulled into a Civil War between the great Houses, he is eager to ensure Zaknafein is armed with weapons befitting his skill, including one in particular: Khazid’hea. A powerful artifact, the sword known as “Cutter” has started wars, corrupted its users, and spilled the blood of many, many people.
